/**
 * AMCAF — Chris Hodges' extension, 281 keywords at slot 8. Freeware.
 *
 * The largest third-party extension in the archive and the best documented:
 * a 235KB AmigaGuide with a real manual entry for 234 of the 280 distinct
 * keywords, and 279 of the 281 names appearing somewhere in it.
 *
 * ## Identity: one port, two releases
 *
 * `amcaf-1.40` (26-Dec-95) and `amcaf-1.50` share **268 keyword names**.
 * 1.50 adds twelve and removes none, so it is 1.40 plus additions rather than
 * a reworking — which is exactly why the 1.50 manual documents 1.40. One port
 * serves both, the way the two Personnal releases and the three TURBOs do.
 *
 * ## Evidence tier: manual for 1.40, disassembly for what 1.50 added
 *
 * The author says so himself: *"AMCAF V1.50beta4 is the FINAL RELEASE!
 * FREEWARE!"* and, of the manual, *"Sorry, but I didn't have time to update
 * the manual. You'll have to find out the new commands since V1.40
 * yourself."*
 *
 * So the honest split is **manual tier for the 1.40 subset** and
 * **disassembly tier for the twelve 1.50 additions** — the transparency
 * group (`Trans Screen Static/Dynamic/Runtime`, `Alloc`/`Set Trans
 * Map`/`Source`), `Alloc Code Bank`, `Turbo Text`, `Pt Free Voice`, `Sload`
 * and `Ssave`. C2P is undocumented too: it appears only in the history node,
 * crediting Mikael Kalms' routine.
 *
 * Where the two disagree the binary wins. `extdis amcaf-1.50` decodes a
 * 45,532-byte code hunk, jump table at +18, 354 routines from $1c28.
 *
 * ## The Guide's history node is a primary source
 *
 * Unusually, the manual carries a dated changelog going back to 1993, and it
 * documents behaviour nothing else records — including bugs the author found
 * and fixed. Two examples worth having on file before the graphics slice:
 *
 * - *"Found and removed an error in the Blitter Fill commands. Blitter Fill
 *   filled the screen one line to deep -> memory got corrupted."*
 * - *"Error in the tokenlist caused a wrong syntax of Blitter Fill to be
 *   converted into Pt Play. Funny :)"*
 *
 * Both are FIXED by the releases we hold, so neither is reproduced; they are
 * recorded because a program written against an older AMCAF may have been
 * built around them.
 *
 * ## There is no error message table
 *
 * Unlike Personnal, JVP, TURBO and AMOS 3D, this extension ships **no error
 * strings at all** — the whole 45KB hunk contains no printable message text.
 * Failures go through AMOS's own error numbers, which the manual confirms
 * when it blames one on the host: *"this is a problem of AMOS"*.
 *
 * The one exception points the other way: `Io Error` and `Io Error$` return
 * **AmigaDOS** error codes and strings, not AMOS ones — *"Returns the last
 * dos error code"*, *"Returns a dos errorstring"*. Those belong to
 * `dos.library` and are slice 5's problem, not an extension error table.
 *
 * ## Contested names
 *
 * Thirteen of the 281 names are also spelled by something else, and seven of
 * those are ARMED — the other side is already ported, so a plain-name
 * registration would silently replace a working implementation:
 *
 *   Blitter Clear, Blitter Copy, Blitter Copy Limit,
 *   Set Ntsc, Set Pal, Speek              -> Personnal
 *   Sload, Ssave                          -> the Music extension, EME
 *
 * The decision is to declare all eight `qualified` in EXT_IMPLS, so they
 * register as `ext8:<name>` and dispatch resolves them by the slot the
 * program actually bound — which is what the machine does, where the two are
 * different tokens at different slots and coexist. Personnal keeps the plain
 * names.
 *
 * They cannot be declared ahead of the keywords: `extimpl.test.ts` requires
 * every qualified name to be one the port actually defines, which is what
 * stops the list rotting into a wish. So the declarations arrive with their
 * slices — Sload/Ssave in slice 5, the six Personnal names in slice 7.
 *
 * The remaining six are latent (neither side ported): `Bank Name`,
 * `Bank Name$`, `Open Workbench`, `Pal Spread`, `Raster Wait`, `Xfire`.
 *
 * ## State
 *
 * The extension keeps one data block, which `Amcaf Base` and `Amcaf Length`
 * hand a program the address and size of. Nothing is in it yet; each slice
 * adds the fields its keywords need.
